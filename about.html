            <p>Astronaut horse is a series of open-ended collaborations between visual artists / students and a group of professional software engineers and machine learning researchers who began working with Stable Diffusion together at the Recurse Center in late 2022.</p>
            <p>The name astronaut horse refers to the common AI-generated image of an astronaut riding a horse that often acts as a benchmark for the capabilities of generative image models.</p>

                Stable Diffusion is a free and open-source alternative to image-generating AI tools like DALL-E and Midjourney which remain private and for-profit. The tools developed for this project are similarly intended to be free for artists to use and help develop. You can read more about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion">wikipedia</a>.

        <!-- <h2>Astronaut Horse 🧑‍🚀</h2> -->
        <!-- <h2>astronaut horse</h2> -->
        <p>Astronaut horse is a series of exhibitions, artist workshops, free AI artist tools and talks based on open-ended collaborations between visual artists / students and a group of professional software engineers and machine learning researchers who began working with Stable Diffusion together at the Recurse Center in late 2022.</p>
        <p>The name astronaut horse refers to the common AI-generated image of an astronaut riding a horse that often acts as a benchmark for the capabilities of generative image models.</p>
        
        <!-- <h2>minimal hype</h2>
        <p>
            Hype can fuel a lot of amazing energy and innovation in new technologies, but it can also be distracting and discourage people from sincere long-term investement. The hope is that this project stays grounded in things that can play a more sustainable role in visual artist's studio practices.

        <h2>Artist Collaborations 🎨</h2>
        <!-- <h2>artist collaborations</h2> -->
        <p>
            Collaborations with visual artists began in 2022 with a series of Stable Diffusion fine-tunings (using textual inversion training) on artist-chosen images of their own artwork as well as images that inspired their studio practices. Collaborations have since expanded to be open-ended explorations seeking new ways to incorporate generative models into artist's long-term creative practices.

        <h2>Community Grant 🤗</h2>
        <p>
            Since late 2022 this project has been generously supported by a Community GPU Grant from Hugging Face, one of the most prominent groups providing free resources to the larger Stable Diffusion community. This grant allows the GPU-powered app linked above to stay running and accessible to anyone any time.

        <h2>Workshops &amp; Tools 📝</h2>
        <!-- <h2>open workshops</h2> -->
        <p>
            The project has several student / community workshops planned focused on hands-on creative projects introducing participants to basic coding skills and the conceptual foundations of generative AI tools. The resources for these workshops are freely available on this website.
