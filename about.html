        <p>Astronaut horse is a series of open-ended collaborations between visual artists and a group of professional software engineers and machine learning researchers who began working with Stable Diffusion together at the Recurse Center in late 2022.</p>

        <p>Stable Diffusion is a free and open-source alternative to image-generating AI tools like DALL-E and Midjourney which remain private and for-profit. The tools developed for this project are similarly intended to be free for artists to use and help develop.</p>

        <p>The name astronaut horse refers to the common AI-generated image of an astronaut riding a horse that often acts as a benchmark for the capabilities of generative image models.</p>

        <p>To learn more about the project check out the links below. If you're interested in potentially collaborating feel free to reach out to me directly with some links to your work.</p>
