        <p>Astronaut horse refers to the ubiquitous image of an astronaut riding a horse that has come to act as a  benchmark for the abilities of generative image models like Stable Diffusion.</p>

        <p>Stable Diffusion is an open source generative image model whose code can be freely run, studied, manipulated and reimplemented. It is fundamentally distinct from previous generative image models like DALL-E and Midjourney which are for-profit ventures whose code and training details are not public.</p>

        <p>This site hosts collections of output images from <a href="collaborations.html">collaborations</a> between visual artists (humans) and Stable Diffusion by way of by textual inversion training sessions.</p>
        
       <p>The code and resources used for these collaborations is all available in the <a href="resources.html">resources</a> section of this site.</p>
