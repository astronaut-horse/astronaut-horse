        <h2>The Project...</h2>
        <p>Astronaut horse is a series of open-ended collaborations between visual artists and a group of professional software engineers and machine learning researchers who began working with Stable Diffusion together at the Recurse Center in late 2022.</p>
        
        <h2>Stable Diffusion...</h2>
        <p>
            Stable Diffusion is a free and open-source alternative to image-generating AI tools like DALL-E and Midjourney which remain private and for-profit. The tools developed for this project are similarly intended to be free for artists to use and help develop. You can read more about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion">wikipedia</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Astronaut Horse...</h2>
        <p>The name astronaut horse refers to the common AI-generated image of an astronaut riding a horse that often acts as a benchmark for the capabilities of generative image models.</p>
        
        <h2>AI Workshops...</h2>
        <p>
            The project has several student / community workshops planned focused on developing AI literacy through hands-on creative projects. These will introduce participants to basic coding skills and the conceptual foundations of machine learning.
            <br><br>
            The resources for these workshops will be made freely available as they are developed. The schedule for the currently planned workshops can be found below.
        </p>
