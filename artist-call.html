    <h1>Astronaut Horse / Call to Artists</h1>

    <p>This is an open call for artists to participate in an ongoing series of Stable Diffusion collaborations with visual artists via Astronaut Horse, a group of visual artist, software engineers and researchers working with generative AI tools and machine learning.</p>

    <p>As a visual artist, I don't yet know how I feel about AI, especially tools that seem to be capable of generating art and displacing the few of us that have managed to find a way to support ourselves with our work. My mother was a painter as well as a working illustrator and my studio practice has always been grounded in traditional mediums. Before transitioning to a career in Software Engineering I taught oil painting, life drawing and Art History at campuses in the Southern California desert while sadistically renouncing smart devices, social media and at times having any internet connection at all. I state all this simply to make clear that I am in no way a blind advocate of new technologies in the arts.</p>

    <p>With this said my experiences as an artist and an arts instructor have made it clear to me that denying contemporary technologies is a luxury afforded to established artists that the rest of us simply do not have. If we choose to ignore a revolutionary technology rather than position our work for or against it, we will simply be left behind.</p>
