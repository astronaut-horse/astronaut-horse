# Latent Space Derive / Photography

* fine tuning stable diffusion models / prompt engineering / sorting through output
* feels more and more like a photography practice
* similar numbers in terms of junk vs keepers
* similar time input
* similar emphasis on technical processes time vs capture / editing time
* similar problems of presentation / printing etc
* but instead of wandering through this world, I'm wandering through latent space
* is this a correct interpretation of latent space?
