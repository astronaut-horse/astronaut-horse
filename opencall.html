            <!-- <p>The future of AI is unknown. What kinds of tools will we build with them? Will they create a post-labor utopia where we all receive a universal basic income and are free to make art and eat brick oven pizza? Will they disrupt our economy and put millions of people out of work?</p> -->

            <!-- <p>As visual artists, we have been put in a unique position in the development of whatever future AI holds for us. We have been early victims of it's ability to reproduce certain kinds of artwork, but we also have been given early access to powerful open-source alternatives to for-profit projects like DALL-E and Midjourney.</p> -->

            <p>In late 2022, Stable Diffusion was released to the public. This is a powerful, free and open-source text-to-image AI model that acts as an alternative to proprietary tools like DALL-E and Midjourney.</p>

            <p>As a visual artist, I'm not sure how I feel about AI yet. But shortly after Stable Diffusion's release I was given an exciting opportunity to study it and learn to build software tools with it under the guidance of an inspiring group of software engineers and researchers at the Recurse Center.</p>
                
            <p>This work quickly turned into an ongoing series of collaborations with other artists training Stable Diffusion on images of their work and producing thousands of output images in return.</p>

            <p>Last month the project was unexpectedly given a hardware grant from a leading AI research and development group. This means a wider range of tools that are easier to use and more artists!</p>

        <!-- <p>As a visual artist I don't yet know how I feel about AI, especially tools that threaten any aspect of how artists survive. This project is not a promotion for the use of AI tools in the arts. In short it is an open experiment in developing AI tools made for artists by artists with the central goal of building critical agency.</p> -->
