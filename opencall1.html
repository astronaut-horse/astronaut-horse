            </div>

            <p>This is an invitation for visual artists to participate in an ongoing series of open-ended collaborations with a group of professional software engineers and machine learning researchers working to build freely available AI tools geared specifically towards empowering artists.</p>

            <p>In February 2023 we applied for and received an ongoing hardware grant from a leading AI research and development group that allows us to host a live user-friendly version of our core application (linked below) and accommodate an increased number of collaborating artists.</p> 

            <p>As a visual artist and a human being I don't yet know how I feel about AI, especially generative tools that threaten to displace those of us lucky enough to be making a living through our work. This project is not a promotion for the use of AI tools in the arts, nor is it an attempt to capitalize on the current iteration of AI hype.</p>
                
            <p>In short, this project is an open experiment that seeks above all else to help visual artists develop critical agency in this new technical landscape by inviting them to help create AI tools built specifically for artists and by artists.</p>

            <h2>The project is focused on...</h2>
            <ul class="normal">
                <li>● building free AI tools for artists by artists</li>
                <li>● pursuing co-working over automation</li>
                <li>● building critical agency</li>
                <li>● empowering artists</li>
                <li>● avoiding hype</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key points for artists...</h2>

                <li>● there are no obligations</li>

        <p>If you're curious about potentially collaborating check out the featured collaboration images linked below and play around with the current tools on our live application.</p>
            
        <p>If you're interested in collaborating further with custom trainings, new tools, discussions, exhibitions etc. check out our discord community, we'd be exited to work with you.</p>
