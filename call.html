            <h1>Open Call to Artists</h1>
        
            <p>This is an open call for visual artists to participate in an ongoing series of collaborations with a group of professional software engineers and machine learning researchers from the Recurse Center working to build open generative AI tools geared specifically towards empowering artists.</p>

            <p>As of last month we have attained a hardware grant from a leading AI research and development group that allows us to host a live user-friendly version of our core application.</p> 
                
            <p>This application allows artists to train, prompt and generate images using ai models / concepts fine-tuned to their work.</p>
        
            <!-- <p>As a visual artist and a human being I don't yet know how I feel about AI, especially generative tools designed to create art with the potential to displace the few of us that have managed to find a way to support ourselves with our work. My mother was a painter as well as a working illustrator and my studio practice has always been grounded in traditional mediums. Before transitioning to a career in Software Engineering I taught oil painting, life drawing and Art History at college campuses scattered across the Southern California desert while sadistically renouncing smart devices, social media and at times having any internet connection at all. I state all this simply to make clear that I am in no way a blind advocate of new technologies in the arts and am perennially suspicious of hype, especially around the intersection of art and technology.</p> -->

            <p>As a visual artist and a human being I don't yet know how I feel about AI, especially generative tools that threaten to displace those of us lucky enough to be making a living through our work. This project is not a promotion for the use of AI tools in the arts, nor is it an attempt to capitalize on the current hype surrounding newly developed generative AI models.</p>
                
            <p>This project is an open-ended experiment that seeks above all else to help artists attain critical agency in this rapidly evolving technical landscape.</p>
        
            <!-- <p>With this said AI art generation tools are having a new moment of fevered energy, seemingly more so than in the previous iterations of AI art excitement that have resurfaced rhythmically since the 1940's. And while I fully respect artists who choose to deny these technologies any credence in their studios, my experiences as an artist and an arts instructor have made it clear to me that denying contemporary technologies is in many ways a luxury afforded to established artists and recluses that many of us simply do not feel we have.</p> -->
